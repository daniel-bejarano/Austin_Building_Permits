# Austin_Building_Permits
Analysis of Austin's Building Permits Distribution Plus a Model to Predict Permit Approval Time

This notebook uses a public dataset from the City of Austin. The dataset contains information about building permits issued (mainly) over
the last 20 years. It does not include the whole dataset available, but rather the first 100,000 observations available.

The analysis includes the following:
1. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the features included in the dataset. 
2. A data pre-processing section to clean the data, select most predictive features, and configure the data to be fed into predictive models
3. Predictions on the duration of building permits approval period. Two models were used: Linear Regression, and Ensemble Gradient Boost.
